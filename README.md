### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Allan. I'm UBC CS grad and a SFU Econ grad. This github is just a collection of things I've made in the pass. I really enjoy laerning ML / Data and Security. In my spear time I love reading networking forums and testing out Linux distributions. Another hobbie of my is hacking / breaking video games. I like writing small scripts to automated my video game character. 

Currently I'm working on setting up learning Haskell beacause I want to understand more on functional programming. 

The best way to reach is Linkedin.
